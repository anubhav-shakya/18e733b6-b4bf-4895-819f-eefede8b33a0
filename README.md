# 18e733b6-b4bf-4895-819f-eefede8b33a0

## Objective
- Translate a problem into a working solution
- Demonstrate clear understanding of C# .NET.
- Communicate solution using clean code that is easy to read/understand
- Demonstrate ability to unit test code
- Provide clear instructions on how to verify solution

## Stretch goals
- Continuous integration of solution using Github actions 
- Solution containerisation using Docker
- Code linting
- Code coverage reporting

## Problem
Develop a function that takes one string input of any number of integers separated by single whitespace. The function then outputs the longest increasing subsequence (increased by any number) present in that sequence. If more than 1 sequence exists with the longest length, output the earliest one. You may develop supporting functions as many as you find reasonable.
